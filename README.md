# Apartment Calculator

Welcome to my terminal-based apartment calculator.

## Why do I need one?

Living with flatmates can be rough.

Dealing with the constant flow of utility bills can be exhausting.

Especially when one of the flatmates goes on a "vacation", and is absent from the apartment for a few days.

Even worse when he's not the only one, and the "vacations" don't overlap.

When the utility bill comes, it wouldn't be fair if the amount was split evenly between everyone.

## I'm here to help!

After months of manual calculation, I wrote this script that does it for me!

### Please note:

It's for my personal usage, so I haven't included any error catching.
So don't try breaking it ;)

Have fun!
